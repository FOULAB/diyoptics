This repo contains the designs for the optics bench parts demonstrated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XwIKG2f8oM

These images are meant for conversion to gcode. I used the online tool jscut, but any cam software should work. Cut the inner parts first so the material doesn't need to be reattached to the mill.
